# Project summary

```html
<p>
  The project was well made and came out pretty well. It is layed out to have
  different sections for different bits of information and each person did a
  part.
</p>

<p>
  I made the layout of the page using CSS. Below is an example of the code used
  to make the layout.
</p>
```

# Code Descriptions

```css
 {
  width: 62.5vw;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: #faf0e6;
  margin-top: 3.5%;
  margin-right: 4.5%;
  float: right;
  border-radius: 30px;
}

 {
  font-family: "Playfair Display", serif;
  margin-left: 20px;
  margin-top: 21px;
  font-size: 2rem;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

 {
  font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
  text-align: justify;
  letter-spacing: 0.5px;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  margin-top: 1%;
  padding-bottom: 30px;
  padding-left: 20px;
  padding-right: 20px;
}
```

```html
<p>The code above also is how I made my body section.</p>

<p>
  Many things like Margins, VW and VH, padding and font size hold our project
  together.
</p>

<p>
  Since I was responsible for making the layout I had to make sure everyone knew
  to keep their VW and VH the same so nothing collided or overlapped with other
  sections.
</p>

<p>
  If someone needed more space so they could fit the information they needed on
  their section they were supposed to ask me for help so I could go through and
  help everyone else fix their sections but, I basically got excluded from the
  project.
