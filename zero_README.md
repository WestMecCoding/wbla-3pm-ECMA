# Documentation for Zero's Contribution 

> Here's some info about my contrubution: I made the footer by using the elements of UL's and LI's for my HTML, for the css I mainly used display flex to get my items to center in the div as well as overflow hidden to keep all that information in the div.

```html
<div id="footer">
<ul>
    <li>one</li>
    <li>two</li>
    <li>three</li>
    <li>four</li>
</ul>
</div>
```

```css
#footer {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    margin: auto;
    justify-content: space-around;
}
```
